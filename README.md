# GitHub Copilot Demo walkthrough
In this tutorial, we are going to detail all the steps to demonstrate GiHub Copilot with a few live examples. This walkthrough relies on Visual Studio Code and Python programming language. Nowadays, both VS Code and Python are popular tools in developer environments.


## Prerequisites

Before running the sample you need to install:
 - Visual Studio Code
 - GH Copilot + GH Copilot Chat extension
 - Python Extension
 - Python framework
 - Python modules: requests fastapi and uvicorn

Then, register a new free account on [Ð¡urrent weather and forecast - OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)




## Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code

**First sample**

    Hello, I'm a junior developer and I would like to learn python, what are the first steps?

In Copilot Chat, type:
    Can you write a web API that returns the weather forecast with the previous function get_weather stored in weatherforecast.py file with FastAPI

To run this app, save the code to a file named app.py and run the following command in your terminal
